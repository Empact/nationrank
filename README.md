NationRank
==========

This is a project to use D3 and node.js to beautifully and informatively convey comparative information between countries. Originally inspired by: http://stateofworldliberty.org

This is also me learning node.js and D3.js, so be gentle. :-)

It will eventually be hosted at: http://nationrank.org
