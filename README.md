NationRank
==========

This is a project to use D3 and node.js to beautifully and informatively convey comparative information between countries. Originally inspired by: http://stateofworldliberty.org

This is also me learning node.js and D3.js, so be gentle. :-)

It will eventually be hosted at: http://nationrank.org

I have some notes [on hackpad](https://hackpad.com/ep/group/740), e.g. [Inspirations](https://hackpad.com/pNxOgj8h78Q#Inspirations) and [Data Sources](https://hackpad.com/gh1nIQLOr7A#Data-Sources). Feel free to add to them if you have ideas or suggestions.
